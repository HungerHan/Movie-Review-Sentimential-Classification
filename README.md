# Movie-Review-Sentimential-Classification

The ability to classify the hidden sentimental information in text is a fundamental needed in many situations. Most of the existing study conduct their research on CNN (Convoluted Neural Network) and focus on modifying the CNN architecture for better performance. And the classification results always fall into two groups – negative and positive. This paper presents the development of two effective methods of sentimental classification after fully exploring the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset [1]. One model is Estimator-Transformer – method 1, another is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) – method 2. Because of the difficulty coming from five sentiment classification labels, to figure out the performance matrix and the best method for sentiment classification, various models were analysed and compared.

Finally, in this paper, a LSTM network taking sequence relation into consideration is presented as the ideal method, which has high accuracy and is with a relative simple architecture. Plus, this paper also illustrates the most suitable pair of estimator and transformer for the sentiment classification task.
